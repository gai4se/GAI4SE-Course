## Group Project

### What is a good presentation? 

[Partial source](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall22/cos597G/)

  - The oldest paper we are going to read is 4 years old. Most papers were published in the past 1-2 years (if not a few months).
  - They represent the state-of-the-art of the field and our _current understanding_ of LLMs
  - All research builds on previous research: putting things in context when you read and present a paper!! You are expected to read more if you want to fully understand papers
  - When you present a paper:
    - Highlight the biggest take-aways
    - Think about why this paper is important
    - Explain the characteristics of the used data
    - Pay attention to technical details too
    - Choose and present experimental results properly
    - (Bonus) What can be done in the future?
